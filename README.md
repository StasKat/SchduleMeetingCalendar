# SchduleMeetingCalendar
Allows a client to set a certain meeting time/date, furthermore allowing them to create their own holiday/vacation time. 
This application is NOT complete and needs a lot of work to be fully functional, I'd like to add support for holidays using a Web API or figure a different way to solve this issue.
